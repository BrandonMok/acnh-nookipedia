## Animal Crossing New Horizons Nookipedia
In the Animal Crossing New Horizons Nintendo Switch game, there are numerous bugs, fish, sea creatures, 
and more that the player can collect. The game offers a reference app called "Nookipedia" that
contains all info that a player can use pertinent to those collectibles already caught.
From availability to location and lastly to prices, the Nookipedia is a valuable app and resource to reference.

## Nookipedia built in React
This project served as another learning and experimental opportunity to work with React. 
It allowed me to tinker more with my current knowledge of the library while also offering opportunities to explore other
offerings like the React router. Nevertheless, this project was a fun and enjoyable project to work on.
