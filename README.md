## Animal Crossing New Horizons Nookipedia
In the Animal Crossing New Horizons Nintendo Switch game, there are numerous bugs, fish, sea creatures, 
and more that the player can collect. The game offers a reference app called "Nookipedia" that
contains all info that a player can use pertinent to those collectibles already caught.
From availability to location and lastly to prices, the Nookipedia is a valuable app and resource to reference.

## Nookipedia built in React
This project served as another learning and experimental opportunity to work with React. 
It has allowed me to tinker more with my current knowledge while also exploring other features and related libraries such as React Router. Nevertheless, this project was a fun and enjoyable project to work on. 

## Note:
There may be additional features and pages added in the future. The API used offers more data related to the ACNH game
that would make great additions. However, future additions to the React site/application is left to available downtime if any.
